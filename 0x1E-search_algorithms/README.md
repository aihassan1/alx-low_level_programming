# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

This project explores search algorithms in the C programming language. It includes implementations of linear search and binary search algorithms, along with analyses of time and space complexities.

## Files

- **0-linear.c**: Contains the implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- **1-binary.c**: Contains the implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- **2-O**: File containing the time complexity of a linear search in an array of size n.
- **3-O**: File containing the space complexity of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.
- **4-O**: File containing the time complexity of a binary search in an array of size n.
- **5-O**: File containing the space complexity of a binary search in an array of size n.
- **6-O**: File containing the space complexity of a function to allocate a 2D array.

## Compilation

All C files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following flags:

## How to Use

- To test the linear search algorithm, compile the `0-linear.c` file along with a test file containing a `main()` function. For example:
- Run the compiled executable to see the output.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, one should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand the concepts of linear search and binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm to use depending on specific needs.
- Analyze the time and space complexities of algorithms.

## Restrictions

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory.
- Code must use the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library.
- Header file with function prototypes must be included.
- Header files must be include guarded.
